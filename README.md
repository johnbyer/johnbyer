- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @johnbyer. I'm brand new to programming, and looking to ultimately make a career change.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything on the "maker" side of things. I own a CNC Router and a 3D printer,
- am converting a Sprinter van into a camper with an overly complicated electrical system, and enjoy 
- pretty much everything outside.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Arduino, and Fusion 360, with a lot of other random things thrown in 
- as I beome interested in them.

- ðŸ“« I can be reached at johnwilliambyer@gmail.com or @ModernDayWanderlust on Instagram.
